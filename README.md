# switchy-rule-lists

This repo contains rule lists for Browser extensions such as Proxy SwitchySharp and Proxy SwitchyOmega

How to use
Install SwitchyOmega
Open Chrome browser, and proceed to install Switchy Omega extension.

Set up a proxy profile
First, you must have your own proxy. We do not provide a proxy, VPN. We highly recommend a SOCKS 5 proxy (see why in "Caveats" section).

In the extension settings for SwitchyOmega, set up a proxy profile (using a proxy server of your own or found elsewhere).

Configuration
Create a switch profile, or using the default auto switch profile. In the switch profile, proceed to "Rule List Config" and enter URLs below depending on the country of residence.

Countries
When located in the country listed, use its rule list in order to gain informative decision about using restricted websites in that country.

Requests to restricted websites will be routed through your proxy.
